# Qiskit-Fall-Fest

Goal of the Hackathon Challenge: Finding the best test accuracy using one or more quantum machine learning algorithms, with or without the influence of noise.

Task Description:

1. The dataset is first be trained using traditional machine learning algorithms to figure out the best test accuracy.
2. Then two QML algorithms VQC and QSVM are used to obtain best accuracy without the effect of noise.
3. And finally the target is to improve the test accuracy under noisy scenario.

I worked on classifying the data using VQC under ideal conditions
